    "* Configure Databricks to access Key Vault secrets\n",
    "* Read and write data directly from Blob Storage using secrets stored in Key Vault\n",
    "* Set different levels of access permission using SAS at the Storage service level\n",
    "* Mount Blob Storage into DBFS\n",
    "* Describe how mounting impacts secure access to data\n",

    "\n",
    "This goal has been broken into 3 notebooks to make each step more digestible:\n",
    "1. `1 - Blob Storage` - In the first notebook, we will add a file to a Blob on a Storage Account and generate SAS tokens with different permissions levels\n",
    "1. `2 - Key Vault` - In the second notebook, we will configure an Azure Key Vault Access Policy and add text-based credentials as secrets\n",
    "1. `3 - Key Vault` Backed Secret Scopes - In the third notebook, we will define a Secret Scope in Databircks by linking to the Key Vault and use the previously stored credentials to read and write from the Storage Container"
